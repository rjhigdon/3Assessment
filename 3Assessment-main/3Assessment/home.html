					<!--Despite numerous efforts I cannot seem to get radio and label on the same line I researched and copy pasted some codes just to see how it translated and did the same thing w the copied code that should have been setup to have them side by side so idk also tried id and float on css.I then tried doing a flex row to make it look better and that too was not working(uncomment it if youd like to see in css) seems to be stuck to the bottom no matter what would love to know why it wont format the way I want it to though -->
